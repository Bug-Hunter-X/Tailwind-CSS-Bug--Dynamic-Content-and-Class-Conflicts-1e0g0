# Tailwind CSS Bug: Dynamic Content and Class Conflicts

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS related to dynamic content and class application. The bug manifests when dynamic content alters the layout or size of a component, leading to styling inconsistencies. The issue is not directly related to Tailwind's core functionality but rather stems from how dynamic content interacts with the class application mechanism.

## Bug Description
The provided `bug.js` file shows a component with Tailwind classes that work perfectly when the content is static. However, when the content becomes dynamic (e.g., changing text length), the styling might break unpredictably.  This could involve issues like text overflowing, unexpected padding/margin changes, or misalignment.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution that tackles the issue by adding some techniques to handle dynamic content in a way that maintains consistency in the Tailwind CSS styling.  This solution may involve using responsive utilities, adjusting class application based on content length, or employing JavaScript to dynamically update Tailwind classes based on changes in component state.
